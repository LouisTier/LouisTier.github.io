## Current Research Projects

### Mathematical Foundations of Deep Learning
I am exploring the theoretical underpinnings of deep learning models, focusing on understanding their generalization capabilities, expressivity, and optimization landscapes. This research combines techniques from approximation theory, statistical learning theory, and dynamical systems.

### Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning
This project focuses on developing principled approaches to quantify uncertainty in machine learning predictions, with applications in risk-sensitive domains. I'm particularly interested in Bayesian approaches and ensemble methods that provide robust uncertainty estimates.

### Model-Based Optimization Techniques
Building on my previous work in model-based quality-diversity optimization, I'm developing surrogate-assisted optimization techniques for complex optimization problems, with a focus on improved sample efficiency and exploration capabilities.

## Previous Research

During my MSc at Imperial College London, I worked in the [Adaptive & Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/) under the supervision of [Dr. Antoine Cully](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.cully). My research focused on:

### Model-Based Quality-Diversity Optimization

Quality-Diversity (QD) optimization is a branch of evolutionary algorithms that aims to find a collection of diverse and high-performing solutions to a problem. Traditional QD algorithms require many evaluations, which can be expensive in real-world applications.

<div class="research-highlight">
  <p>My work introduced a novel model-based approach to QD optimization that significantly improves sample efficiency. By using surrogate models to guide the search, we reduced the number of required evaluations while maintaining the quality and diversity of solutions.</p>
  
  <p>This research has applications in robotics, design optimization, and other domains where evaluation costs are high but solution diversity is desired.</p>

## Industrial Collaboration

I am actively seeking industrial collaboration opportunities during my PhD. As I plan to transition to industry after completing my doctorate, I'm particularly interested in research projects with practical applications.

Collaboration options include:
- Focused internship periods
- Regular part-time engagement (e.g., 1-2 days per week)
- Joint research projects with specific deliverables
