I am a PhD Student in Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/). My research focuses on advancing the field of machine learning through mathematical foundations and innovative applications.

My research interests include:
- **Applied Mathematics & Machine Learning** - Developing theoretical frameworks and practical applications
- **Bayesian & Probabilistic Learning** - Quantifying and exploiting uncertainty in non-deterministic environments
- **Machine & Deep Learning** - Focusing on model-based algorithms and generative models (VAE, GAN, Diffusion, Flow)
- **Optimization** - Developing and applying optimization algorithms to solve complex problems

Prior to my PhD, I completed my MSc in Computer Science and Mathematics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked in the [Adaptive & Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/) under the supervision of [Dr Antoine Cully](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.cully). My master's thesis work is available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LouisTier/Model-Based_Quality-Diversity) and the complete thesis can be found [here](/files/pdf/IRP_LouisBERTHIER.pdf).

## Research Focus
My current research at École Polytechnique combines rigorous mathematical foundations with practical machine learning applications. I am particularly interested in:
- Theoretical foundations of machine learning
- Advanced optimization techniques
- Applications in scientific computing and data analysis

## Application Areas
My research has potential applications in various domains:
- Scientific Computing & Simulation
- Finance & Risk Analysis
- Control Systems & Robotics
- (Quantum) Physics
- Complex Systems Modeling

After my PhD, I will be looking to join the industry rather than stay in academia, so I am keenly interested in an **industrial collaboration** during this thesis.  
This collaboration could take the form of condensed internship blocks, or distributed days of work each week to meet the company's needs.  

Here are some **application sectors** that interest me:
- Finance & Risk 
- Supply Chain & Operations Management
- Neuroscience
- Control & Robotics
- (Quantum) Physics
- Video Games
