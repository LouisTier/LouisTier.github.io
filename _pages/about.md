I am an MSc Student in Computer Science and Mathematics who recently graduated from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). I am looking for PhD opportunities in Computer Science.  

Many areas of research interest me:
- **Bayesian & Probabilistic Learning** in non-deterministic environments to quantify and exploit the uncertainty
- **Machine & Deep Learning** , specifically using model-based algorithms and generative models (VAE, GAN, Diffusion, Flow) to better exploit their latent space
- **Optimization** using optimization algorithms to solve performance problems in different ways 

I had the chance to tackle these topics through my thesis at Imperial College London in the [Adaptive & Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/) under the supervision of [Dr Antoine Cully](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.cully). You can find my work via this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LouisTier/Model-Based_Quality-Diversity) as well as my thesis via this [PDF](/files/pdf/IRP_LouisBERTHIER.pdf).

After my PhD, I will be looking to join industry rather than stay in academia, so I am keenly interested in an **industrial collaboration** during this thesis.  
This collaboration could take the form of condensed internship blocks, or distributed days of work each week to meet the company's needs.  

Here are some **application sectors** that interest me:
- Finance & Risk 
- Supply Chain & Operations Management
- Neuroscience
- Control & Robotics
- (Quantum) Physics
- Video Games
