## About Me

I am passionate about combining rigorous mathematical principles with innovative machine learning approaches to solve complex problems. My research focuses on mathematical foundations of machine learning, with particular interests in Bayesian methods, generative models, and optimization techniques.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my MSc in Computer Science and Mathematics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked in the [Adaptive & Intelligent Robotics Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/) under the supervision of [Dr. Antoine Cully](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.cully). My master's thesis explored novel approaches for Quality-Diversity optimization using model-based techniques.

I also hold a BSc in Applied Mathematics from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), where I developed a strong foundation in mathematical modeling and computational methods.

## Research Focus

My current research at École Polytechnique combines mathematical foundations with practical machine learning applications, focusing on:

## Industrial Collaboration Interest

I am keenly interested in forming **industrial collaborations** during my thesis. As I plan to join industry after my PhD, I'm looking for opportunities to apply my research in practical, real-world settings.

These collaborations could be structured as:
- Condensed internship blocks
- Distributed working days each week
- Project-based collaborations

Areas of particular interest include:
- Finance & Risk Analysis
- Supply Chain & Operations Management
- Neuroscience
- Control & Robotics
- (Quantum) Physics
- Video Games

If you're interested in collaborating or discussing potential applications of my research, please [contact me](/cv/).
