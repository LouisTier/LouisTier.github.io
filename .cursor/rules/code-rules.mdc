# Personal Website Development Rules

## 1. Content Clarity & Structure

- Keep all sections concise. Avoid verbose paragraphs.
- Prioritize above-the-fold content. Place your name, role, and primary CTA (e.g., CV or contact) at the top.
- Use headings strategically: one unique `H1`, followed by hierarchical `H2`/`H3` as needed.
- Add descriptive `alt` text to all images for accessibility and SEO.
- Limit external links in the main navigation; prefer internal anchor links.

## 2. Design & UX

- Apply consistent spacing: uniform padding and margins across components.
- Use 1â€“2 font families. Prioritize readability over aesthetic variety.
- Define and apply a consistent, high-contrast color palette (dark-on-light or light-on-dark).
- Implement hover/tap feedback on all interactive elements (e.g., links, buttons).
- Use `cursor: pointer` only on clickable elements.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness with media queries (e.g., `max-width: 768px`) and layout tools like Flexbox or Grid.

## 3. Performance

- Minimize image sizes; prefer WebP or compressed PNG formats.
- Load JavaScript and CSS asynchronously or use `defer` attributes where appropriate.
- Use a static site generator (e.g., Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby) if scalability or templating becomes necessary.
- Enable Gzip or Brotli compression during deployment.
- Host fonts locally for improved performance and privacy.

## 4. SEO & Metadata

- Add essential meta tags: `title`, `description`, `og:title`, `og:image`, etc.
- Use semantic HTML5 elements: `<main>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`.
- Create and include a `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.
- Set `lang="en"` in the root `<html>` tag.

## 5. Version Control & CI/CD

- Use feature branches for all development work.
- Enable GitHub Pages previews or deploy previews for non-main branches.
- Integrate HTML/CSS linting with GitHub Actions or another CI system.
- Include `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` if Node.js tooling is used.

## 6. Privacy & Analytics

- Include a GDPR-compliant cookie banner if using tracking/analytics.
- Use privacy-focused analytics tools (e.g., Plausible, Fathom).
- Remove or avoid unnecessary third-party scripts and trackers.
